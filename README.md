# prompt-patterns

## Overview

- Reusable prompt structures for different tasks

- Instructional, comparative, QA, and data extraction patterns

---

## Learning Objectives
- Learn key prompt design patterns

- Transform a single use-case into a reusable prompt template

- Improve weak prompts by applying structured patterns

---

## Exercises of the quest
**Note: All submitted answers will be scanned using an AI Detector. If your response is identified as being generated by an AI tool (ChatGPT, etc.), it will be rejected. Make sure to write answers in your own words and avoid copying AI-generated text.**

**Exercise 0:** Environment and Libraries

**Exercise 1:** Summarization pattern

**Exercise 2:** Data extraction template

**Exercise 3:** Prompt transformation with patterns

---

## Virtual Environment
- OpenAI Playground or ChatGPT interface

- Python 3.9+ installed locally (for optional data handling tasks)

---

## Exercise 0: Environment and Libraries
**Objective:** Set up the environment for Python development.

- Install Python (latest stable version, preferably 3.9+).

- Verify installation by running:

python --version
Write and execute a Hello, World! program.

---

## Exercise 1: Summarization Pattern
**Objective:** Create a reusable prompt for text summarization.

- Write a weak prompt: "Summarize this text."

- Refine it into a reusable pattern:

"Summarize the following text in 3 bullet points, focusing on the main arguments and ignoring examples."

Test it with at least two different inputs (e.g., a news article and a technical blog).
**

## Exercise 2: Data Extraction Template
**Objective:** Extract structured data from unstructured input.

Choose an unstructured text (e.g., "John Doe, age 29, lives in Paris and works as a software engineer.").

Create a template prompt:

"**Extract the following fields from the text: Name, Age, Location, Occupation. Return the output in JSON format.**"

Validate the output and ensure consistency across multiple inputs.

---

## Exercise 3: Prompt Transformation with Patterns
**Objective:** Strengthen weak prompts using patterns.

Take a vague or under-specified prompt (e.g., "Write about climate change.").
**
Transform it using instructional or comparative patterns:

***Instructional***: "Write a 200-word explanation of climate c***hange for high school learners."

***Comparative:*** "Compare the effects of climate change on coastal vs inland regions in 5 bullet points."

Document the improvement in clarity and usefulness of the outputs.

## Submission
Provide all exercises. For each exercise include the prompts, model outputs, and a brief sentence analysis explaining improvements, consistency, and clarity of outputs. For Exercises 1 and 2, show multiple inputs to demonstrate reliability. For Exercise 3, document comparisons between weak and improved prompts, highlighting how the applied patterns strengthened outputs.
