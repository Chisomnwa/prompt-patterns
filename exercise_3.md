# Exercise 3: Prompt Transformation with Patterns

**Objective: Strengthen weak prompts using patterns.**

Take a vague or under-specified prompt (e.g., "Write about climate change.").

Transform it using instructional or comparative patterns:

Instructional: "Write a 200-word explanation of climate change for high school learners."

Comparative: "Compare the effects of climate change on coastal vs inland regions in 5 bullet points."

Document the improvement in clarity and usefulness of the outputs.

**The first prompt**

Instructional: "Write a 200-word explanation of climate change for high school learners."

**It's response:**

### What is Climate Change?

Climate change refers to long-term changes in the Earth’s climate, especially a rise in average global temperatures, shifts in weather patterns, and increasing frequency of extreme weather events. It is primarily driven by human activities that release greenhouse gases (GHGs) like carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O) into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, creating a “greenhouse effect” that warms the planet.

#### Causes of Climate Change**

**Burning Fossil Fuels**

- Coal, oil, and natural gas release large amounts of CO₂.

- Transportation, electricity generation, and industry are major contributors.

**Deforestation**

- Cutting down forests reduces the planet’s ability to absorb CO₂.

- Leads to loss of biodiversity and disrupts local climates.

**Agriculture and Livestock**

- Livestock produce methane, a potent GHG.

- Fertilizers release nitrous oxide, which also traps heat.

**Industrial Processes**

- Factories and chemical industries emit greenhouse gases.

- Certain refrigerants and aerosols are highly potent contributors.

#### Effects of Climate Change

**Rising Temperatures**

- Global average temperatures have increased by over 1°C since pre-industrial times.

- Heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense.

**Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels**

- Glaciers and polar ice caps are melting, causing sea levels to rise.

- Low-lying areas and islands face flooding risks.

**Extreme Weather Events**

- Stronger storms, hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires.

- Agriculture and water supplies are heavily affected.

**Ecosystem Disruption**

- Species struggle to adapt, causing habitat loss and extinction.

- Coral reefs are bleaching due to warmer oceans.

**Human Health and Economy**

- Heat-related illnesses, food shortages, and water scarcity increase.

- Damage to infrastructure and livelihoods from floods and storms has economic costs.

#### Mitigation and Adaptation

**Renewable Energy**

- Solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

**Energy Efficiency**

- Buildings, vehicles, and industries can use less energy.

- Smart technologies help monitor and optimize energy use.

**Reforestation and Conservation**

- Planting trees and protecting forests absorb CO₂.

- Wetlands and mangroves also store carbon effectively.

**Sustainable Agriculture**

- Reduced fertilizer use, improved livestock management, and crop rotation.

**Policy and Global Agreements**

- Agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit global warming to below 2°C.

- Countries commit to reducing emissions and investing in clean technologies.

#### Conclusion

Climate change is one of the most serious challenges facing humanity. Its impacts are already visible worldwide, and without decisive action, the consequences will worsen for ecosystems, communities, and economies. Combating climate change requires global cooperation, sustainable practices, and long-term commitment to protecting the planet for future generations.

Heere, the propmt is tranformed using instructional pattern.

**Instructional: "Write a 200-word explanation of climate change for high school learners."**

**It's response:**

Climate change is the long-term change in Earth’s average weather patterns. While Earth’s climate naturally changes over time, human activities have caused these changes to happen much faster. The main driver is the increase of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄), in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, creating a “greenhouse effect,” which warms the planet.

One major source of greenhouse gases is burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy. Deforestation also contributes because trees, which absorb CO₂, are being cut down. As the planet warms, we see melting glaciers, rising sea levels, more extreme weather like storms, heatwaves, and droughts, and disruption of ecosystems. Animals may struggle to survive, and humans can face problems like food shortages and flooding.

Climate change is a global problem, but it can be addressed. Solutions include using renewable energy (like solar and wind), planting trees, reducing waste, and changing transportation habits, such as using public transport or biking. Every small action counts. Understanding climate change helps young people make informed choices and prepare for a future where both humans and nature can thrive. Learning and acting now can help slow down its harmful effects.

My observation in clarity and usefulness of the outputs: So, I noticed that in the first prompt, the model gave me an outlined explanation of climate change  where it used bullet points to talk about the causes, effects, and mitigation in bullet points. But., at the same time, it used more sophisticated words.

While in the second instructional prompt, even though I gave it a 200-word limit, it gave a more explanatory output, one with simple words and very easy to understand by high school leaners.

This shows that the way we construct our prompts matters a lot, and can be influenced bby the uadience who is going to be presmted the outputs.
