### Basketball - health benefits

Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world and one of the most widely viewed. It is a team sport that involves two teams of five active players each trying to score points against one another by throwing a ball through a 300 cm (10 feet) high hoop (the ‘basket’) under organised rules. It is played on both indoor and outdoor courts.

The size of the court, height of the basket, size of the basketball, and length of time that the game is played, can all vary according to the age, size and skill level of players.

Basketball is a fast moving game that involves a lot of variety, including shooting, dribbling, passing, rebounding, defence and much more.

**Health benefits of basketball**

Basketball involves a lot of starting and stopping. While not renowned as an aerobic sport, it is still a great workout that can help you:

- burn calories (an hour of basketball can burn 630–750 calories)
- build endurance
- improve balance and coordination
- develop concentration and self-discipline
- build up muscle.

**Other benefits of basketball**

As well as being a great way to stay fit, basketball can also:

- help you to make new friends and see them regularly teach you about being a good team player
- be played by people of all ages and all abilities
- be played all year round because it’s usually an indoor sport
- be a fun game that kids of all levels and ages can enjoy
- be practiced alone – all you need is a ball and a hoop (and you can find a hoop in most local parks and school grounds)
- be played and enjoyed with as few as two people (although official games require 10 players).

**Getting started with basketball**

Although official games of basketball require 10 players, you can play a game of basketball with just one other person. You can also go out and shoot baskets by yourself. If you want to play basketball competitively, you can become a member of a team and get involved in local competition. Check out your local sports centres and associations for information on how to join a team, or start your own.

**Basketball equipment**

One of the great things about the game is that apart from having a basketball, you require very little other equipment to play. However, as basketball involves a lot of running and jumping, it can also be wise to have:

- basketball or sports shoes that provide good ankle support
- mouth guards
- protective knee and elbow pads.

**Basketball and children**

Basketball is a great way for kids to get active and have fun. ‘Aussie hoops’ is a national introductory basketball program for primary school children, started by Basketball Australia and the Australian Sports Commission. It provides primary school girls and boys of all ages, abilities and skill levels, with the opportunity to play basketball and develop sport and social skills in a safe environment.

The program is delivered at local schools, community centers and local stadiums throughout Australia, by local associations and trained professionals. To find your local association, contact Basketball Victoria on (03) 9927 6666.

**Some general tips**

Suggestions include:

- Adults should check with their doctor before taking up basketball.
- Be aware that basketball is a fast-action game with lots of running, jumping, pivoting and twisting, so injuries and accidents can happen easily.
B- asketball puts a lot of stress on the legs, especially the knees and ankles, and puts pressure on tight shoulders.
- Protect yourself by becoming strong and flexible, as basketball is a very physically demanding game.
- Warm up and stretch your muscles and joints before hitting the court. Also cool down and stretch after playing.
- Make sure you have plenty of fluids on hand and rehydrate regularly.
- Don’t overdo it (this will depend on your age and condition). Mix it up with other low-impact sports.
- While playing in a full team competition is great, you can also have fun and benefit from a small space, a basket and a game of one on one.

#### Responses from the first prompt based on the first text

**Question 1: SUmmarize this text**

Basketball is a popular team sport played by two teams of five players who score by shooting a ball into a 10-foot hoop. It can be played indoors or outdoors, and game rules, court size, and equipment may vary depending on players’ age and skill level. The sport involves skills like shooting, dribbling, passing, rebounding, and defending.

Basketball provides many health benefits, including burning calories, building endurance, improving balance and coordination, strengthening muscles, and developing concentration and self-discipline. Beyond physical fitness, it promotes teamwork, social interaction, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and abilities. It can also be played casually with just one or two people.

Getting started requires minimal equipment—mainly a ball and a hoop—though proper sports shoes and protective gear are recommended. While basketball is fun and beneficial, players should warm up, stay hydrated, avoid overexertion, and take precautions to prevent injuries, as it is a physically demanding sport.

### Stroke survivors trial new at-home tech: 'It's given me my freedom back'

Stroke survivors trial new at-home tech: 'It's given me my freedom back'

Shiona McCallum

Senior technology reporter

BBC Amanda, our case study, is seated wearing a grey tracksuit with her hand raised.BBC
Amanda James-Hammett was just 37 when she had a stroke while doing the dishes at home.

"I heard a pop in my head, like a big bubble," she said.

"I tried to scream, but it wasn't a normal scream. I knew something wasn't right."

Within hours, Amanda had lost the ability to speak and move her right arm. She would later have to relearn how to talk, read and carry out everyday tasks.

Six years on, she has participated in a nationwide NHS trial testing a new "at home" device that it's hoped could help stroke survivors regain hand and arm movement.

"It's about freedom," Amanda says. "It's given me my freedom back."


The technology is being tested at 19 NHS sites across the UK, led by Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in partnership with the University of Sheffield.

Researchers behind the £2m study - known as the Triceps trial - say it is the largest trial of brain stimulation and stroke ever conducted. It aims to recruit around 270 people.

"Stroke is an interruption to the blood supply to the brain," says Dr Sheharyar Baig, a neurologist at Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

"When the blood supply is interrupted, unfortunately the brain stops functioning in a certain area. That can lead to all manner of symptoms, from weakness to visual problems and speech problems."

Signs can include:

- Face weakness – it might be hard to smile, and one side of your face may droop
- Arm weakness – you may not be able to fully lift both arms and keep them there because of weakness or numbness in one arm
- Speech problems – you may slur your words or sound confused

People displaying any of these symptoms are advised to call 999.

Dr Baig says stroke is "the leading cause of adult-onset disability in the UK", affecting about 100,000 people a year.

More than a million people living with its long term effects, he says.

Around half of stroke survivors experience ongoing arm weakness, which can range from loss of dexterity to no movement at all.

It can make everyday tasks such as dressing, cooking and working difficult.

With a knock-on effect of adding to pressure on health and social care services, finding ways to help people shift their recovery from hospital to their own homes can be vital.

**How the device works**

Participants in the Triceps trial use a small electrical device that sits inside the ear and stimulates the vagus nerve - a major nerve connecting the brain and abdomen - while carrying out rehabilitation exercises.

A watch, smartphone and the portable device with an ear piece on a table. The smartphone displays an interface to control the device, saying "service stopped" and "press 'start".
The device, resembling a wired earphone, sits in the ear. It works alongside a portable device worn on the wrist, connected to smartphone.
"The recovery process is unfortunately quite slow for many people," Dr Baig says, adding it can involve lots of effort and hours of rehabilitation.

"So we're interested in ways we can boost the effects of rehab and create a brain environment that's more responsive to it."

Unlike earlier versions of vagus nerve stimulation, which required surgery to implant a device, this treatment is non-invasive and can be used at home.

Dr Baig adds the pulses sent by the ear piece are set at a level to operate comfortably and without pain.


'A new woman'
Amanda used the device for up to an hour a day as part of her rehab over 12 weeks, combining it with exercises and everyday tasks.

"At first I didn't think it was going to work at all," she says.

"But after a couple of weeks, I started to see changes in my hand."

One of the biggest milestones for her was returning to sewing – a passion she could not initially pursue after her stroke.

Amanda is sitting at a white sewing machine, with some fabric in her hand.

Amanda says she feels like "a new woman" now that she can cut material and use her sewing machine again.

"I can put my socks on, I can do my shoes, I can do my house," she tells the BBC.

"I don't have to wait for anyone else."

**Early improvements**

So far, more than 200 people have taken part in the trial.

While researchers do not yet know who is receiving active stimulation and who is receiving placebo, they say early signs are promising.

"We have seen some wonderful improvements in people's arm function," Dr Baig says.

But he also stresses the treatment is not a cure, rather something they hope will help people in everyday life.

"Somebody who was unable to carry a cup of tea with one arm can now walk from room to room holding it stably," he says.

"Another person set their post-stroke personal best in a 5K run and noticed their arm function was better when they were running."

The results of the Triceps trial are also being closely monitored by the Stroke Association, which is part-funding the research.

"The team are doing brain imaging and taking blood tests because we know that some stroke patients really respond well to this technology while some don't," said Maeva May, the charity's associate director of systems engagement.

"We want to understand what patients respond best and how."

Dr Baig says if effective, the tech could be "quite scalable" because it is affordable, convenient and can be easily integrated into existing rehab services.

For Amanda, the impact is already clear.

"It's about being independent again," she says. "Those small things make a big difference."

**Question 1: SUmmarize this text**

A nationwide NHS trial in the UK is testing a new at-home, non-invasive brain stimulation device designed to help stroke survivors regain arm and hand movement. Led by Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in partnership with the University of Sheffield, the £2m Triceps trial is the largest study of its kind, involving around 270 participants across 19 sites. Stroke, which affects about 100,000 people annually in the UK and is a leading cause of adult disability, often leaves survivors with long-term arm weakness.

The device stimulates the vagus nerve through a small earpiece while users perform rehabilitation exercises at home, aiming to enhance the brain’s responsiveness to therapy. Unlike older treatments, it does not require surgery and is designed to be comfortable and easy to use.

Early results from more than 200 participants are promising, showing improvements in arm function, though researchers stress it is not a cure. For participants like Amanda James-Hammett, who had a stroke at 37, the technology has helped restore independence in daily activities, significantly improving quality of life.
